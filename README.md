# Face Recognition Attendance System

## Overview

The **Face Recognition Attendance System** is a Python-based application that uses face recognition technology to take attendance in real-time. This system captures a person's face, identifies them using a pre-trained face recognition model, and logs their attendance into a CSV file with timestamps.

## Features

- Real-time face detection and recognition using the camera/webcam.
- Automatic attendance logging with names and timestamps.
- Pre-trained model for face recognition using `dlib` and `face_recognition` libraries.
- Simple and intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) for ease of use.
- Attendance stored in a CSV file for easy access and further processing.
